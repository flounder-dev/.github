### A small development effort.

The HTC Nexus 9 was a tablet produced by HTC in partnership with Google to make another tablet like their last two, the Nexus 7, and the Nexus 10. 

We're looking to try and breathe some new life into this thing, one way or another, rather that's getting a mainline kernel working, or getting the device tree into an Android 14-ready state.
